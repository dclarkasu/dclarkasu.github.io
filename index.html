		<h3> Deciding Between Equalities </h3>
			<p> '=' is for giving a variable value. It defines what something is or what it
			consists of. Once a variable has value it is "initiated" and can be used.
			The symbol '=' is used to give value with integers, Strings, etc. at the beginning
			of or throughout a program. </p>
			<p> '==' is used to compare whether or not numeric values are equal to one
			another. The symbol does not give a variable new value, instead it determines
			whether or not two things have the same value or not. It can be used for Strings
			but, only in a certain way , if you want it to compile (which makes it not the 
			best choice for Strings). '==' is often used in 'if' statements to determine
			what part of the program will be run next. </p>
			<p> '.equals()' is a method to compare Strings (like '==' for numbers). It determines
			whether or not the String to the left of '.' is equal to what is in parentheses.
			It returns a boolean value and in order to test whether they are different you
			must use the not ('!') operator. '.equals()' is often used to help the program
			know which result to print on screen when the user inputs an answer to a question.
			
		<h3> 'While', 'do-while', and 'for' Loops </h3>
			<p> Like 'if' statements, 'while' loops will run the ensuing body of code when
			their condition is checked and returns a value of true. 'while' loops however,
			will continue to run the code as long as that statement remains true ('if' statements
			only run once). The condition of a 'while' loop is written first and checked before
			running the code which is why it is sometimes called a "pre-test." After running,
			the computer will return to the top and check the condition again. 'while' loops
			are useful for having a user continue to guess until they are correct. </p>
			<p> 'do-while' loops differ from 'while' loops in that they always run their
			code at least once and check the condition at the end. This us useful for when 
			the condition you are checking isn't fully known till after the code has run once.
			The loop begins with 'do' and ends with 'while' (the condition). 'do-while' loops
			will also continue to run as long as their condition is met. </p>
			<p> 'for' loops are a little more distinguishable from the 'while' loops. 'for'
			loops are used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat something.
			They would be appropriate for requiring an action 10 times or producing a certain
			number of printed statements determined beforehand. They are made up of three things:</p>
				<ol>
					<li> <strong>Initialization statement</strong> </li>
					<li> <strong>Condition</strong> </li>
					<li> <strong>Update statement</strong> </li>
				</ol>
