		<h3> Deciding Between Equalities </h3>
			<p> '=' is for giving a variable value. It defines what something is or what it
			consists of. Once a variable has value it is "initiated" and can be used.
			The symbol '=' is used to give value with integers, Strings, etc. at the beginning
			of or throughout a program. </p>
			<p> '==' is used to compare whether or not numeric values are equal to one
			another. The symbol does not give a variable new value, instead it determines
			whether or not two things have the same value or not. It can be used for Strings
			but, only in a certain way , if you want it to compile (which makes it not the 
			best choice for Strings). '==' is often used in 'if' statements to determine
			what part of the program will be run next. </p>
			<p> '.equals()' is a method to compare Strings (like '==' for numbers). It determines
			whether or not the String to the left of '.' is equal to what is in parentheses.
			It returns a boolean value and in order to test whether they are different you
			must use the not ('!') operator. '.equals()' is often used to help the program
			know which result to print on screen when the user inputs an answer to a question.
