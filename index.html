		<h1> A Technical Blog From a non-Technical Guy </h1>
		<h3> Deciding Between Equalities </h3>
			<p> '=' is for giving a variable value. It defines what something is or what it
			consists of. Once a variable has value it is "initiated" and can be used.
			The symbol '=' is used to give value with integers, Strings, etc. at the beginning
			of or throughout a program. </p>
			<p> '==' is used to compare whether or not numeric values are equal to one
			another. The symbol does not give a variable new value, instead it determines
			whether or not two things have the same value or not. It can be used for Strings
			but, only in a certain way , if you want it to compile (which makes it not the 
			best choice for Strings). '==' is often used in 'if' statements to determine
			what part of the program will be run next. </p>
			<p> '.equals()' is a method to compare Strings (like '==' for numbers). It determines
			whether or not the String to the left of '.' is equal to what is in parentheses.
			It returns a boolean value and in order to test whether they are different you
			must use the not ('!') operator. '.equals()' is often used to help the program
			know which result to print on screen when the user inputs an answer to a question.
			
		<h3> 'While', 'do-while', and 'for' Loops </h3>
			<p> Like 'if' statements, 'while' loops will run the ensuing body of code when
			their condition is checked and returns a value of true. 'while' loops however,
			will continue to run the code as long as that statement remains true ('if' statements
			only run once). The condition of a 'while' loop is written first and checked before
			running the code which is why it is sometimes called a "pre-test." After running,
			the computer will return to the top and check the condition again. 'while' loops
			are useful for having a user continue to guess until they are correct. </p>
			<p> 'do-while' loops differ from 'while' loops in that they always run their
			code at least once and check the condition at the end. This us useful for when 
			the condition you are checking isn't fully known till after the code has run once.
			The loop begins with 'do' and ends with 'while' (the condition). 'do-while' loops
			will also continue to run as long as their condition is met. </p>
			<p> 'for' loops are a little more distinguishable from the 'while' loops. 'for'
			loops are used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat something.
			They would be appropriate for requiring an action 10 times or producing a certain
			number of printed statements determined beforehand. They are made up of three things:</p>
				<ol>
					<li> <strong>Initialization statement</strong> </li>
					<li> <strong>Condition</strong> </li>
					<li> <strong>Update statement</strong> </li>
				</ol>
		<h3> Choosing Between Decision Making Statements </h3>
			<p> 'if/else' statements are incredibly useful and I look forward to becoming
			more proficient with them. In particular, 'if' statements start with "if" and are
			followed by a condition which must be a boolean expression. If the condition is true
			then the following body of code is run, if it is false, it is skipped. 'else' combined 
			with 'if' statements make it possible to run an alternate body of code if the 'if'
			statement is not true. You don't have to figure out the logical opposite of the condition,
			just use 'else.' </p>
			<p> 'else if' (together) create another option where after skipping a false 'if' statement's
			code, the program searches for the first true 'else if' statement and runs its
			code instead. Only one 'else if' statement will be run, the first one that is true. </p>
			<p> 'switch' statements make use of cases and colons. A 'switch()' statement is made
			with a variable in parentheses and 'case' statements holding values that may match the
			initial variable. The program searches through the cases until it finds a match and then it
			runs the code on the opposite side of the colon until a 'break' which ends that body. 
			Uses:</p>
				<ul>
					<li> 'if/else': Making decisions like discerning which code to run next based off of
					user input. </li>
					<li> 'switch': You can utilize the "fall-through" ability of cases (written without the 'break'
					in between) to allow multiple cases, which equal different variables, to produce the same
					result. </li>
				</ul>
		<h3> Method Declaration and Returning Values with a Function </h3>
			<p> In a method declaration such as 'public static void main', "void" means that there will be 
			no value returned. When calling a function with 'void' the program will carry out whatever
			action you ordered but it will not return anything new. Instead of 'void' you can declare
			a return type such as 'double', 'int', 'boolean', or 'String' if you want the function to 
			return a value equal to one of those. </p>
		<h3> "Parameter" vs. "Argument," is There a Difference? </h3>
			<p> Yes, in short, I believe there is a difference and a reason for two different words.
			In some circles they may be interchangeable among teams that understand one another, but 
			there will still be need for clarification with other people. </p>
			<p> "Parameter" is the variable in the declaration of a function. For example, in exercise 35 
			of Java the Hard Way, the function being called is showDice(roll) and "roll" is the variable. 
			The parameter is the variable called roll. The "Argument" in this case is the actual data that
			is entered into that variable (roll). In this case it is required to be an integer. So
			showDice(1) is an acceptable argument because the final product is one integer. Therefore, their
			use can occur within the same program, or body of code, where a function is being called.</p>
